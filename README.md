# MakePlace to Teamcraft List Converter

This is a tool for converting MakePlace JSON files to Teamcraft lists in the browser.

This works best when used with newer versions of MakePlace, older versions handled dyes differently and may not identify them correctly.
If your dyes are wrong, try opening the MakePlace file in the latest version of the MakePlace itch.io program and saving it again.
